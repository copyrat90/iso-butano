# iso_butano

iso_butano is collections of helpers I wrote for the [Butano Engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano).

Currently only `iso_bn::variable_wait_sprite_animate_action<MaxSize>` is available,
which is a wrapper that adds variable `wait_updates` to the `bn::sprite_animate_action<MaxSize>`.

More to come, probably?
