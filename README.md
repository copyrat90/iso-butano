# iso_butano

iso_butano is collections of helpers I wrote for the [Butano Engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano).

## Included items

### 1. `iso_bn::variable_wait_sprite_animate_action<MaxSize>` class

This is a wrapper that adds variable `wait_updates` to the `bn::sprite_animate_action<MaxSize>`.

### 2. `iso_bn::random` class

This adds getters & setters to the internal seed in `bn::random`.

## License

Source code's license is exactly same as [Butano Engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano), which means I didn't put my name on it.\
This is because:

1. This is a *derivative work* for the Butano.
2. The changes are just a little tweaks that anyone can come up with, so I don't deserve my name on it.
