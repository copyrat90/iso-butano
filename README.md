# iso_butano

iso_butano is collections of helpers I wrote for the [Butano Engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano).

## Included items

### 1. `iso_bn::variable_wait_sprite_animate_action<MaxSize>` class

This is a wrapper that adds variable `wait_updates` to the `bn::sprite_animate_action<MaxSize>`.

### 2. `iso_bn::random` class

This adds getters & setters for the internal seeds in `bn::random`.
